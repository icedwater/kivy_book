# kivy_book

Another walkthrough of a library book which I plan to finish at some point, this
time it is the O'Reilly paperback **Creating Apps in Kivy**. The book requires a
setup with Kivy 1.8, but as it was published in April 2014, Kivy must have moved
forward since that time.

As of this commit, the [latest version][new] is *Kivy 1.9.0*. Download the right
install package for your operating system on the download page linked above. You
might prefer to clone the [github repo][kgr] directly.

I'll be working through the chapters in order, so this is walkthrough will be at
my pace. If you have your hands on [the book][get], feel free to work on at your
preferred speed.

Content here will be on a MIT License, just like the Kivy toolkit itself. I just
don't know yet which version to use.
